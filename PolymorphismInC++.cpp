//  Polymorphism : A object to be in many forms is said to be the polymorph object And the property is Polymorphism.
//                 In simple way one name multiple forms...
//                 Ex. Function overloading.

// In C++ there are two types of polymorphism :
//                    1. Compile-Time Polymorphism : 
//                                             the object is bound to the method call in compile time (we know that which function will execute), 
//                                             i.e which function will be called is decided in the time of compilation , Also known as Static binding 
//                                             and Early binding.

//                                             We can achieve this polymorphism through 2 ways :
//                                                             a) Function Overloading
//                                                             b) Operator Overloading
                    
//                     2. Run-Time Polymorphism : 
//                                             the compiler delays the decision of the function call (we don't know which fuction will be called),
//                                             i.e compiler postponds the linking of functions and arrangement of function calls and These are 
//                                             arranged in runtime. 
                                        
//                                             We can achieve this polymorphism through Virtual Functions.
